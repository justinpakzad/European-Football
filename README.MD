# European Football Exploration
In this project, we immerse ourselves in the realm of European football. Coming from a  sports betting company angle, our focus is to understand the factors that impact match outcomes and goal numbers, and how we can use this information to find predictable patterns in teams.

## Part One: Data Preprocessing
Here, we began by preparing the data, extracting key insights, and creating new CSVs to streamline our analysis and machine learning processes. We explored missing values and gained a comprehensive overview of the data we were dealing with.

## Part Two: Football Analysis
In this part we got to explore the dataset, raising and answering questions, trying to understand what factors influence the outcome of a match, which teams could be most lucrative and more.

## Part Three: Machine Learning Models
In the final stage, we developed models to predict match outcomes and the number of goals scored. We experimented with different models and feature sets to enhance our predictions, aiming for profitable and low-risk betting opportunities.
